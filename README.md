# Breast-Cancer-Detection
How can understanding the patterns and relationships between different cell features contribute to early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer?

# Abstract
According to Breast Cancer Org, 30% of newly diagnosed cancer among women in the US alone are breast cancer cases. In 2024, approximately 310,720 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, 16% of which will be in women younger than 50 years of age. With an incidence rate of numbers that cannot be ignored. Despite advancements in diagnostic research, accuracy of identifying malignant and benign is still a challenge.
This project aims to develop a model to predict whether a tumor is cancerous or not based on the characteristics of the tumor. These findings emphasize the need for personalized screening initiatives, evidence-based decision-making, and targeted prevention programs to ensure better utilization of healthcare resources and improvement in patient outcomes. The study helps narrow the gaps in early detection and contributes to enhancing the precision and access of diagnostic practices related to breast cancer.


# Significance
This study seeks to improve our knowledge of the factors influencing breast cancer risk by using techniques, like KNIME for data analysis specifically focusing on breast density and body mass index along with other clinical risk elements to better estimate breast cancer risk in women both before and after menopause This study's findings could have important implications for public health and medical procedures by guiding the creation of personalized screening initiatives and preventive measures for individuals, at high risk. Furthermore, building models, with machine learning methods, like decision trees or random forest can enhance the precision of risk assessment. Help healthcare professionals pinpoint individuals who would gain the most from early intervention** This initiative has the potential to enhance breast cancer prevention techniques. Ultimately lessen the impact of this illness on society.
